For my Code Louisville Project I decided to create a portfolio. 
This project I can utilize in the future when applying to positions as well as a continous project I hope to add on to as my skills continue to grow. 

The requirements for this projects and how I utilzed them are below.

1. Retrieve data from a
third-party API and use it to
display something within your
app.

It was a struggle for me personally to find a good fit for an API on a portfolio rather than a portfolio piece.
I utilized the News-API as a fun way at the end of the page for folks to look up whats new in the tech scene.
You can enter whatever you are interesested in seeing top news articles about and it will list the top 5.
It was fun as well to figure out how to get less data (for once) and pull 5 articles rather than 100.

2. Use a regular expression to
validate user input and either
prevent the invalid input or
inform the user about it (in all
cases prevent invalid input
from being stored or saved).

If user hits the submit button an alert will appear showing "Input field is Empty"

3. Visualize data in a user
friendly way. (e.g. graph,
chart, etc)

I utilzed Chart.js and gothered information on Github to display a readar chart for the number of entries or contributions I have made in Github for 2022.

4. Use arrays, objects, sets or
maps to store and retrieve
information that is displayed
in your app.

Chart.js also utilzes arrays for the data collected for entries and months seen on the chart.

Outside of the requirements I had the most fun for the beginning loading page utilzing my logo and a SetTimeout function to add a personalized look to my logo as 
the main focal point when entering the site.
